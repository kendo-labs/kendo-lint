# kendo-lint

## About kendo-lint

A static analysis (linting) tool that checks your usage of Kendo UI objects... automatically!

## Compatibility and Requirements

kendo-lint was designed to inspect your Kendo UI configurations in a terminal environment with Node.js

kendo-lint currently depends on the following libraries:

- Node
- NPM
- UglifyJS
- Glob
- Markdown
- Optimist

kendo-lint has not been tested against any other versions of these libraries. You may find that versions other than these are compatible with kendo-lint, but we make no claims to support those version, nor can we troubleshoot issues that arise when using those versions.

## Installation

    npm install -g kendo-lint

## Usage (command-line)

    kendo-lint [options] [files]

If no file names are given, it will read from STDIN.  By default it
parses STDIN as JavaScript, pass `--html` to parse as HTML.

When file names are passed, the type will be determined from the
extension, but it can be forced with either `--js` or `--html`.

To output results as a JSON array, pass `--json`.

## API

    var kendoLint = require("kendo-lint");

### lintJS(code, filename)

    var results = kendoLint.lintJS(code, filename);

Use this if you already have the code in memory.  No file is read, the
`filename` argument is just included in the results array, which will
contain objects like this:

    { filename: filename,
      message: "Warning message",
      line: the line number,
      col: the column }

### lintJSFile(filename, callback)

Pass the full path to the file to lint.  Your callback is invoked with
two arguments, `error` and `results`.

### lintHTML(code, filename)

Use this to lint HTML code.  It's similar to `lintJS`, except that for
the time being we cannot report line/column information.

### lintHTMLFile(filename, callback)

Similar to `lintJSFile`, but for HTML code.

## What it does

The Kendo linting tool will search for code that constructs Kendo
widgets, and check the passed options against the API documentation.
Any mismatches are reported (invalid option name, or invalid type for
option).

For JavaScript it looks for code like this:

```js
(...).kendoWidgetName({ ... })
```

and check the options inside the brackets.  It checks nested options
too.

For HTML it searches MVVM constructs, like:

```html
<div data-role="widget-name" data-option="..."> ... </div>
```

and tries to validate the widget name and given options against known
API.  However, <script> tags are treated specially in HTML,
specifically:

- if there is no `src` attribute, and there is no `type` or there is a
  `type` that indicates that the content is JavaScript, then the
  content will be linted via `lintJSFile`.

- if there is a `type` attribute containing the string "template" it
  will assume that the template generates some kind of HTML, so the
  content will be linted via `lintHTMLFile`.

### To update the API documentation

As mentioned, the linter relies on knowledge it gets from the Kendo
API documentation, so it will be as good as the docs.  The data is
stored in `lib/api.json`.  To update this file, pass `--parse-docs
/path/to/kendo-docs-repo`.
